# ClawdHub Skills To Install

**Source:** Twitter recommendation from Miles Deutscher (Feb 4, 2026)
**Priority:** Security first, then productivity enhancements

## 🔴 High Priority - Security

### 1. Prompt Guard
**Link:** https://clawdhub.com/seojoonkim/prompt-guard  
**Purpose:** Advanced prompt injection defense system  
**Why:** We're handling trading API keys and credentials - injection attacks are a real risk  
**Install:** Soon

### 2. Security Self-Check (dont-hack-me)
**Link:** https://clawdhub.com/peterokase42/dont-hack-me  
**Purpose:** Security audit tool  
**Why:** Validate our setup before going live with real trading capital  
**Install:** Soon (pair with prompt-guard)

## 🟡 Medium Priority - Productivity

### 3. Find-Skills
**Link:** https://clawdhub.com/JimLiuxinghai/find-skills  
**Purpose:** Auto-discover and install skills when asking "how do I...?"  
**Why:** Currently in HEARTBEAT.md to manually check for skills - this automates it  
**Install:** After security tools

### 4. Supermemory
**Link:** https://github.com/supermemoryai/clawdbot-supermemory  
**Purpose:** Unlimited memory for Clawdbot  
**Why:** Just struggled with memory management today - could eliminate manual daily logs  
**Questions:** How does storage/retrieval work? Quality of recall?  
**Install:** Test after find-skills

## 🟢 Low Priority - Research First

### 5. QMD-Skill (Moltbot)
**Link:** https://github.com/levineam/qmd-skill  
**Purpose:** Cuts token usage by 95%  
**Why:** Massive API cost reduction for long sessions  
**Concerns:** 95% sounds too good - what's the quality tradeoff?  
**Install:** Research thoroughly first, test on non-critical tasks
