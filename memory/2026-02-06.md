## 🎉 MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Git Push Workflow SOLVED

**The Problem:**
- I kept losing the ability to push to GitHub after container restarts
- Spent 30+ minutes each session troubleshooting permissions
- MEMORY.md had completely wrong information (said I couldn't push at all)

**Root Cause:**
- Workspace owned by UID 1000, container runs as root (UID 0)
- Git blocks operations due to ownership mismatch
- Container root filesystem is read-only
- Git safe.directory config doesn't persist

**The Solution:**
Andrei provided GitHub personal access token (stored in .env as GITHUB_TOKEN)

**Implementation:**
1. Saved token to `/workspace/.env` as `GITHUB_TOKEN` (gitignored)
2. Created `/workspace/git-push-helper.sh` script
3. Script clones to `/tmp`, authenticates with token, and pushes

**Usage:**
```bash
bash /workspace/git-push-helper.sh "Commit message"
```

**Key insight:** The /tmp workaround works because:
- I own /tmp as root (no permission issues)
- Token from .env persists across container restarts
- Helper script in workspace survives rebuilds

**Documentation:**
- Updated MEMORY.md with correct workflow (removed stale "I can't push" section)
- Created CONTAINER_RESTART_PROCEDURES.md
- Script is ready to use immediately after any restart

**This solves a recurring problem that was wasting significant time every session!**

## Email Setup - Current Status ✅ Partial

**What works:**
- ✅ Can READ email from new Gmail account (via Himalaya)
- ❌ Cannot SEND email yet

**Why sending is blocked:**
- DigitalOcean blocks outbound SMTP ports (25, 465, 587) by default
- Support ticket open to unblock: https://cloudsupport.digitalocean.com/s/case-detail?recordId=500QP00001GhXFBYA3
- Once approved, Himalaya will be able to send via Gmail SMTP

**Next steps:**
- Monitor support ticket during heartbeats
- When ports are unblocked, update Himalaya config
- Test email sending to stiles.mesas_3r@icloud.com

## Lesson Learned

**Stale memory is worse than no memory!**

MEMORY.md had an entire section titled "Git Workflow (CRITICAL - THE REAL PROBLEM!)" that said I CANNOT push from my container and should let Andrei do it. This was completely wrong and was causing me to waste time every session.

**Action taken:** Reviewed and updated MEMORY.md to reflect current reality. Need to do this more regularly during heartbeats.
