## Email Setup Challenge

Andrei asked me to try finding and signing up for an outbound email service so I can send him a test email when he wakes up.

**Goal**: Get working SMTP credentials and send test email to stiles.mesas_3r@icloud.com

**Challenge**: Most free SMTP services require:
- Email verification (manageable - can use his iCloud)
- Phone/SMS verification (blocker - I don't have access to phone)

**Services explored:**
- SMTP2GO: Free tier (100/day), requires SMS verification ❌
- Resend: Free tier (100/day), unclear if phone required
- SendGrid, Mailgun, Brevo: Similar patterns

**Current status**: Researching options that might work without phone verification. May need to document the attempt and report back on what's blocking me.

**Alternative approach**: Could try using an email testing service or see if Himalaya already has any working SMTP configured.
