## SQLite Database Migration

**Major upgrade:** Replaced JSON trade storage with SQLite database.

**Problem with old system:**
- 50K trade limit (rotated after ~13 hours)
- Lost historical data
- All trades stored (even tiny $10 trades)
- Large memory footprint

**New SQLite system:**
- Unlimited storage capacity
- Built-in $2K minimum filter (reduces noise 70-80%)
- Indexed for fast queries
- WAL mode for concurrent access
- Automatic migration from old JSON data

**Files created:**
- `src/utils/sqlite_database.ts` - Database module
- `src/test_sqlite.ts` - Migration test script
- `deploy_sqlite.sh` - Deployment script

**Benefits:**
- No data loss going forward
- Faster queries (indexed by wallet/market/timestamp)
- Smaller memory footprint
- Foundation for long-term analytics

**Expected results:**
- Before: 3,757 trades/hour (all sizes)
- After: 500-1,000 trades/hour (>= $2K only)
- Much cleaner signal, same information density

**Status:** Ready for testing and deployment
