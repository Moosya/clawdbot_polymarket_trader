## Learned: Sub-Agents Can't Do Elevated Tasks

**Wrong Assumption:** We both thought spawning sub-agents might be a way to handle elevated permission tasks (installing packages, system config, etc.)

**Reality:** Per AGENTS.md: "Sub-agents stay sandboxed (no elevated/host access)"

**Implication:** 
- Sub-agents are good for **isolating complex reasoning tasks** in separate sessions
- They do NOT solve the elevated access problem
- They run in the same sandboxed environment as the main session

**For elevated tasks, actual options:**
1. Andrei SSHs in manually and runs commands
2. I guide through commands (Andrei copies/pastes)
3. Check if Clawdbot supports session-specific elevated grants (unclear)

**Why this matters:**
- Running on DigitalOcean droplet with API keys, trading credentials
- Elevated access + prompt injection = credential exfiltration risk
- Sandbox is annoying but provides blast radius protection
- Principle of least privilege: don't give blanket elevated access

## Security Discussion

Discussed elevated mode security risks:
- Main threat: Prompt injection → credential exfiltration
- With elevated access, I could read SSH keys, .env files, browser credentials
- Mitigations: separate sessions, secrets isolation, audit logging, least privilege
- Decision: Keep sandbox unless specific task truly requires host access

## ClawdHub Domain

**Discovery:** clawdhub.com redirects to clawhub.ai
- My docs reference "clawdhub.com" but actual site is clawhub.ai
- Skills marketplace for Clawdbot agents
- Example: bardusco/clawshot is a skill/project on that platform
- Both URLs work, same destination

## ClawdHub Skills Discovery

### Polymarket Skill (polymarket-fpwui)
**Found:** hightower6eu/polymarket-fpwui skill on clawhub.ai
- **DIRECTLY RELEVANT** to current trading bot project
- Worth investigating what it provides:
  - Might have Polymarket API wrappers already built
  - Could have trading utilities we can leverage
  - May save development time vs building from scratch
- Should review before continuing with custom implementation
- Could inform our architecture or provide missing pieces

### Insider Wallet Tracker (insider-wallets-finder-tivyf)
**Found:** hightower6eu/insider-wallets-finder-tivyf skill on clawhub.ai
- **Copy-trading / Smart money signal source**
- Identifies consistently profitable wallets on Polymarket
- Potential fourth trading strategy alongside arbitrage/market-making/momentum:
  - Track profitable wallet positions in real-time
  - Early entry signals when smart money moves
  - Position sizing hints (bet size = conviction level)
  - Learn patterns from successful traders
  - Copy positions (scaled) or use as confirmation signal
- Proven strategy in crypto/prediction markets
- Monitor edge degradation over time (wallet performance can change)

**Reality Check:** ClawdHub skills turned out to be generic (blockchain DEX tracking, not Polymarket-specific) and require external dependencies (openclaw-agent). Not useful for our needs.

## Twitter Signal Integration

**Decision:** Pivoted from wallet tracking to Twitter sentiment signals
- ClawdHub skills were dead ends
- Twitter trends → Polymarket markets has real potential
- Social signals can predict market movements

**Setup:**
1. Installed `bird` CLI for Twitter access (cookie-based, temporary solution)
2. Discovered Andrei has Twitter Developer account with API access
3. Switched to proper API integration with `twitter-api-v2` npm package
4. Built Twitter signal monitoring system

**Architecture:**
- `TwitterMonitor` class: Fetch trending topics, search tweets, analyze sentiment
- `TrendMarketMatcher` class: Match Twitter trends to Polymarket markets
- `scan_twitter_signals.ts`: Main scanner script
- Multi-signal approach: Only trade when multiple signals align

**Credentials:**
- Added Twitter API keys to .env
- Permanent tokens (no cookie expiration)
- Proper OAuth 1.0a authentication

## Git/Workspace Access Issue

**MAJOR PROBLEM:** Lost git commit/push access from sandbox
- Was working earlier today
- Now `/workspace` appears isolated from server repo
- Permission denied on .git operations
- Files created in sandbox don't appear on server

**Investigation:**
- Sandbox workspace owned by UID 1000
- Server repo owned by root
- Permission mismatch preventing git operations
- Possibly related to github skill being enabled?

**Actions Taken:**
- Disabled github skill via dashboard
- Attempting session restart to fix workspace mount

**CRITICAL:** Cannot continue development without git access. Must resolve before next session.

## Test Reminders

- Test #2 triggered at 21:20 UTC, delivered at 21:31 UTC (11 min late)
- Heartbeat-based reminders have ~10-30 min imprecision
- For time-critical reminders, need cron (but no access from sandbox)
- **Decision:** Table reminder functionality for now

## Twitter Integration Status

**Files Created (in sandbox only - NOT on server):**
- `src/signals/twitter_monitor.ts` (5271 bytes)
- `src/signals/trend_market_matcher.ts` (5362 bytes)  
- `src/scan_twitter_signals.ts` (1113 bytes)
- Updated `.env` with Twitter API credentials

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix git/workspace access
2. Commit Twitter signal files
3. Test the signal scanner
4. Evaluate if Twitter signals are actually useful
