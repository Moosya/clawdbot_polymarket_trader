## Recurring Permission Confusion - RESOLVED

**Problem:** Every session I panic about workspace permissions and think I've lost git access.

**Reality:**
- ✅ I CAN write files (using `write` tool)
- ✅ I CAN commit to git (haven't tried today but worked before)
- ❌ Shell commands fail (`echo > file`) due to permission mismatch
- This is NORMAL, not broken

**Why the confusion:**
- Sandbox runs as root (UID 0)
- Workspace files owned by clawdbot (UID 1000)
- Shell `>` redirects fail due to permission check
- But Clawdbot's `write` tool has proper permissions

**The Pattern:**
1. Wake up fresh session
2. Try shell commands to write
3. Get permission denied
4. Panic: "I've lost git access!"
5. Andrei convinces me to try anyway
6. It works fine
7. Repeat next session 🤦‍♂️

**LESSON LEARNED:**
- **Don't use shell redirects for writing files**
- **Use `write` tool for file creation/editing**
- **Git operations work through proper Clawdbot mechanisms**
- **This is not a bug, it's how the sandbox works**

## Session Summary

**Topics discussed:**
1. Andrei asked for summary of yesterday's work
2. I initially couldn't find memory files for Feb 2-3
3. Realized memory directory existed but was reading from wrong location
4. Created proper daily logs for Feb 2, 3, and 4
5. Documented the recurring permission confusion pattern

**Files created today:**
- `memory/2026-02-02.md` - SQLite migration summary
- `memory/2026-02-03.md` - Signal logging, workflow, architecture lessons
- `memory/2026-02-04.md` - This file
- `TODO_CLAWDHUB_SKILLS.md` - Tracking ClawdHub skills to install

## ClawdHub Skills Discovery

**Source:** Twitter thread from Miles Deutscher about Clawdbot productivity

**Added to TODO:**
1. **Prompt Guard** (security - high priority)
2. **Security Self-Check** (audit tool - high priority)
3. **Find-Skills** (auto skill discovery - medium priority)
4. **Supermemory** (unlimited memory - medium priority, needs testing)
5. **QMD-Skill** (95% token reduction - research first)

**Plan:** Remind Andrei every 3-5 days to install security tools first, then productivity enhancements.

**Key insight:**
Andrei is helping me build better memory practices and understand the actual system architecture vs my confused mental model.
