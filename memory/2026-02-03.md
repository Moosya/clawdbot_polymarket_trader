## Signal Logging System

**Created:** Machine-readable logging system for trading signals and performance tracking.

**Purpose:**
- Track all signals (arbitrage, volume spikes, whale trades)
- Log actual trades executed
- Monitor position performance
- Analyze what's working and what's not

**Implementation:**
- JSON Lines format (`signals.jsonl`)
- One event per line (easy to parse with grep/jq)
- Timestamped entries for time-series analysis
- Signal types: SIGNAL, TRADE, POSITION, PERFORMANCE

**Created file:**
- `src/utils/signal_logger.ts` - Logger utility
- `SIGNAL_LOGGING.md` - Integration guide with examples

**Benefits:**
- See which strategies fire most often
- Track win rates by signal type
- Identify false positives
- Data-driven strategy refinement

## Workflow Documentation

**Created:** `WORKFLOW.md` - Best practices for development workflow.

**Key principles:**
1. Plan mode for complex tasks (3+ steps)
2. Use subagents liberally to keep context clean
3. Self-improvement loop (update lessons after corrections)
4. Verify before marking complete
5. Demand elegance (but don't over-engineer simple fixes)
6. Autonomous bug fixing (just fix it, don't ask for hand-holding)

**Core values:**
- Simplicity first
- No laziness (find root causes)
- Minimal impact (surgical changes)

## Drill-Down Features Planning

**Documented:** Future enhancement - wallet and market detail pages.

**Status:** Documented as TODO, implement later

## Architecture Lessons (IMPORTANT)

### User 1000 = clawdbot User
**Discovery:** UID 1000 in directory listings is the `clawdbot` user, not some random user.
- All project files owned by `clawdbot:clawdbot` (1000:1000)
- This is normal and expected
- Not a permission problem, just my confusion about user IDs

### Directory Structure
**Andrei shared:**
- `/opt/clawdbot/` - Main Clawdbot installation
- Polymarket bot lives somewhere in the actual file system
- Skills can be bootstrapped and made available
- Understanding the real structure helps troubleshoot

### How Andrei Sees It vs How I See It
**Key insight:** We had different mental models of the architecture.
- Andrei understands the actual server layout
- I was confused about workspace paths and permissions
- Need to align on: where files actually are, what I can access, what requires his help

### Git Access "Issue"
**Pattern identified:** I think I've lost git access every session, but I haven't.
- I CAN commit and push to GitHub
- Just need to be reminded/convinced each time
- **Lesson:** Don't immediately assume permission errors = lost access
- **Fix:** Try the operation first before declaring it broken

**Root cause of confusion:**
- Sandbox runs as root
- Workspace files owned by UID 1000
- Shell commands fail due to permission mismatch
- BUT: `write` tool works fine
- AND: Git operations likely work through different mechanism

**Going forward:**
1. Don't panic about permissions every session
2. Try writing files with the `write` tool first
3. Git operations should work - just try them
4. If truly broken, THEN investigate with Andrei
